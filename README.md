# Boot2Root
Welcome to the Boot2Root project! This project is a security course at 42 School. Boot2Root is some sort of a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge where you will find vulnerabilities in code and exploit them to progress to your utlimate goal : **become root**.

## Project Overview
This project involves a step-by-step walkthrough of exploiting various known vulnerabilities in a controlled, legal environment, aiming to educate users on system security and vulnerability exploitation. Utilizing exploits like Dirty COW, the project showcases how one can gain unauthorized access to system resources, emphasizing the importance of system security.

## Pedagogical Learnings
1. Understanding Vulnerabilities: Gain a deep understanding of known vulnerabilities like Dirty COW and buffer overflow attacks.
2. Security Measures: Learn about the necessary measures needed to secure a system adequately.
3. Ethical Hacking: Develop skills in ethical hacking, understanding the responsible way to handle vulnerabilities and the importance of consent in security testing.
4. Hands-on Experience: Gain practical experience in exploiting vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

There are three writeups, which allow each of them to obtain an elevation of privileges

[Writeup1 - Step by step](./writeup1.md) - Explore, look for flaws, exploit them 

[Writeup2 - Dirty cow](./writeup2.md) - Exploit the Dirty COW vulnerability through creating and running a C script to temporarily grant themselves root access on a Linux system

[Bonus - Grub exploit](./bonus/writeup1.md) - Exploit grub to become root. Not autorized in the project, just for information.
